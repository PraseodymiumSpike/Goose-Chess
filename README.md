# Goose-Chess
a program in which you can play my chess variant Goose Chess

I recommend using the compatible version! The Goose is represented by an "@" and the Egg by a "*". The King, Queen, Chancellor, Rook, Bishop, Knight, and Pawn are represented by "K", "Q", "C", "R", "B", "N", and "P" if they belong to White and the lowercase versions of the letters if they belong to Black.

important note: To play, follow the directions in red below the chessboard!

important note 2: Draws by Agreement, Resignations, and Draws by Dead Position are not supported by the program! If these events happen, simply close the program and notify your opponent.

important note 3: You need Python installed to play this! You can download it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/. It must be version 3.10 or higher, preferably 3.11.0.
